    -> Learn by Doing
        -> If you haven't already, make your template now
        -> Pull up your file and get to coding
    -> Guidelines for the registration view function:
        -> Display your registration form
        -> Upon a POST request, validate the form
        -> After the form is validated, create the user based on the provided info and add it to the database
        -> Flash a message that the user can now log in, then redirect them to the login page
